# CI/CD Implementation Progress

## Context

To continue this implementation in a new chat session, use:

```
context: implementing basic CI/CD pipeline for Todo app. Progress tracked in _SITE-OFFICE/progress/cicd.md and architecture diagram in cicd.pu. We're following the basic plan focusing on GitHub Actions → GHCR → EC2 → Basic Monitoring.
```

To mark tasks as complete, use:

```
mark: [task name]

## Overview

Basic CI/CD pipeline for Todo App using GitHub Actions, GHCR, and AWS Free Tier EC2.

## Architecture

```
GitHub → GitHub Actions → GHCR → EC2 → Basic Monitoring
```

## Progress Tracker

### 1. Repository Setup [ ]

- [x] Initialize repository
- [x] Configure GitHub repository secrets
  - [ ] AWS credentials
  - [ ] Docker registry credentials

### 2. CI Pipeline [✓]

- [x] Create basic workflow file
- [x] Configure test running
- [x] Configure linting
- [x] Set up Docker build
- [x] Configure GHCR push
- [ ] Verify package published to GHCR
- [x] Add GHCR cleanup workflow (private repo management)
- [x] Configure image retention policy
- [x] Add storage usage monitoring

### 3. AWS Infrastructure [In Progress]

- [ ] Create EC2 instance (t2.micro)
- [ ] Configure security groups
- [ ] Set up SSH access
- [ ] Install Docker on EC2
- [ ] Configure HTTPS (SSL/TLS)

### 4. CD Pipeline [ ]

- [ ] Create deployment script
- [ ] Set up container pull on EC2
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Create basic health check
- [ ] Set up simple rollback procedure

### 5. Monitoring [ ]

- [ ] Set up New Relic free tier
- [ ] Configure basic metrics
- [ ] Set up deployment notifications
- [ ] Configure error tracking

## Notes

- Using AWS Free Tier (12 months)
- Single EC2 instance deployment
- Manual approval for production deployments
- Basic monitoring with New Relic free tier
- Repository made public for full GitHub features access

## Next Steps (Future Phases)

1. Enhanced security measures
2. Automated testing improvements
3. Backup strategy
4. Advanced monitoring
